# Product Context

## Why This Exists

### Problem Statement
Building production-ready multi-agent systems is complex. Developers need to:
- Coordinate communication between multiple AI agents
- Stream real-time updates to user interfaces
- Integrate external tools and services
- Manage state across distributed components
- Ensure system observability and debugging

Current solutions often require custom implementations or proprietary frameworks that lack standardization.

### Solution
The Agentic Stack MVP provides a reference implementation that:
- Demonstrates best practices for multi-agent architectures
- Shows how PydanticAI's three protocols work together cohesively
- Offers a production-ready foundation for building agent systems
- Provides clear patterns for extending and customizing

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. **User Request**: User submits a complex task via the web interface
2. **Task Analysis**: Orchestrator agent analyzes and decomposes the task
3. **Delegation**: Sub-tasks are delegated to specialized agents via A2A
4. **Tool Usage**: Agents access external tools through MCP servers
5. **Real-time Updates**: Progress streams to frontend via AG-UI/SSE
6. **Result Aggregation**: Orchestrator combines results and returns to user

### Key Interactions
- **Frontend ↔ Orchestrator**: AG-UI protocol for bidirectional communication
- **Orchestrator ↔ Agents**: A2A protocol for task delegation
- **Agents ↔ Tools**: MCP protocol for external service access
- **All Components ↔ Redis**: Shared state management

## User Experience Goals

### For Developers
- **Quick Start**: Run entire system with single Docker command
- **Clear Architecture**: Understand component relationships easily
- **Extensible Design**: Add new agents/tools without major refactoring
- **Debugging Support**: Comprehensive logging and tracing

### For End Users
- **Real-time Feedback**: See agent thinking and progress
- **Transparent Process**: Understand how tasks are decomposed
- **Reliable Results**: Consistent, high-quality outputs
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failures

## Value Proposition
This production-ready system serves as:
1. **Learning Tool**: Understand PydanticAI protocols through enterprise-grade working code
2. **Production Foundation**: Complete Clean Architecture implementation ready for deployment
3. **Reference Architecture**: Demonstrates DDD, SOLID principles, and modern Python practices
4. **Integration Example**: Shows how AI protocols work with enterprise architecture patterns
5. **Development Template**: Modern tooling (UV, Ruff) with comprehensive test organization
6. **Operational Example**: Simplified deployment with Docker Compose and direct agent startup
