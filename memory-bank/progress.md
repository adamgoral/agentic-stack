## Current Status

### System State
- **Backend Orchestrator**: Fully functional with result aggregation at http://localhost:8000
- **Frontend**: Fully implemented with CopilotKit, accessible at http://localhost:3000/chat
- **Core Infrastructure**: Redis and PostgreSQL running healthy
- **Research Agent**: RUNNING - container at port 8001, A2A protocol working, needs MCP implementation
- **Code Agent**: RUNNING - container at port 8002, A2A protocol working, needs MCP implementation
- **Analytics Agent**: RUNNING - container at port 8003, A2A protocol working, needs real execution
- **MCP Servers**: FIXED - both web search (3001) and Python executor (3002) running
- **CopilotKit**: Integrated and functioning with AG-UI connection
- **Dependencies**: All fixed and validated
- **Agent Delegation**: TESTED & WORKING - orchestrator correctly routes tasks by type
- **Result Aggregation**: IMPLEMENTED - orchestrator aggregates real responses with proper formatting
- **Task Management**: NEW - centralized async-safe task manager with lifecycle tracking
- **Overall Status**: CORE SYSTEM COMPLETE - agents need MCP tool implementation for full MVP

### Deployment Readiness
- **Local Development**: Ready with Docker
- **Production**: Requires additional security and monitoring

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
1. Mock web search needs real API integration
2. Python executor needs better sandboxing  
3. No authentication mechanism yet
4. Missing comprehensive error handling
5. ~~Analytics agent module not created~~ âœ… Implemented
6. ~~MCP server implementations incomplete~~ âœ… Fixed - converted to HTTP/SSE

### Configuration Issues
- CORS configuration needs testing
- Redis connection pooling not optimized
- MCP server discovery is hardcoded (acceptable for MVP)
- API keys need to be added to .env file for real web search (currently using mock)

### Resolved Issues
- ~~Docker dependency version mismatches~~ âœ…
- ~~Package name errors (mcp-server-fastmcp vs fastmcp)~~ âœ…
- ~~pydantic-ai version constraint (fixed to 0.4.11)~~ âœ…
- ~~Frontend build error (Tailwind CSS border-border class)~~ âœ…
- ~~Missing ag_ui_handler.py module~~ âœ…
- ~~Missing OpenTelemetry instrumentation packages~~ âœ…
- ~~All Docker containers failing to start~~ âœ…
- ~~MCP servers exiting on startup~~ âœ… Fixed with HTTP/SSE conversion

### Testing Infrastructure
1. **Created Test Scripts**: Comprehensive test suite for agent delegation
2. **test_agent_delegation.py**: Full httpx-based test with all delegation scenarios
3. **test_agent_delegation_simple.py**: Lightweight version using built-in libraries
4. **DELEGATION_TEST_REPORT.md**: Detailed test results and findings
5. **Result**: 100% success rate on delegation, A2A communication verified
6. **Task Manager**: Centralized task tracking with async-safe operations
7. **Result Aggregation**: Orchestrator collects and formats real agent responses

## Evolution of Decisions

### Initial Approach
- Started with monolithic design
- Evolved to microservices for better separation

### Protocol Choices
1. **First**: Considered custom protocols
2. **Then**: Decided on PydanticAI standards
3. **Now**: Full commitment to A2A, AG-UI, MCP

### State Management
1. **Considered**: In-memory only
2. **Evaluated**: PostgreSQL
3. **Chosen**: Redis for simplicity and speed

### Frontend Framework
1. **Options**: Vanilla JS, React, Vue
2. **Selected**: Next.js for SSR and CopilotKit compatibility
3. **Implemented**: Full Next.js 14+ with App Router, TypeScript, TailwindCSS

### CopilotKit Integration
1. **Research**: Studied CopilotKit documentation via Context7
2. **Implementation**: Used AgnoAgent for AG-UI connection
3. **Architecture**: Separated client/server components properly
4. **Result**: Full integration with streaming support

### Dependency Management
1. **Initial**: Used estimated version numbers without verification
2. **Problem**: Docker builds failing due to non-existent package versions
3. **Solution**: Verified actual PyPI versions and corrected requirements
4. **Result**: All Docker services now build successfully

### Agent Implementation Strategy
1. **Pattern Study**: Analyzed orchestrator agent implementation
2. **Research Agent**: Created following same patterns with A2A support
3. **MCP Integration**: Connected to web search server via SSE
4. **Docker Support**: Added environment detection for proper networking
5. **Result**: All three agents ready for deployment

### Result Aggregation Strategy
1. **Task Manager Creation**: Centralized async-safe task tracking system
2. **Orchestrator Enhancement**: Added collect_task_results() and aggregate_results()
3. **Agent Runner Updates**: Integrated task manager in all agent services
4. **Formatting Logic**: Results formatted by agent type for clarity
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages
6. **Result**: Orchestrator now aggregates real responses from all agents

### MCP Server Fix Strategy
1. **Problem Identification**: Servers using stdio but agents expected HTTP
2. **Solution**: Convert from FastMCP stdio to FastAPI HTTP/SSE
3. **Implementation**: Added SSE endpoints, tool execution routes, health checks
4. **Verification**: Both servers running and accessible on ports 3001/3002
5. **Result**: Full system connectivity restored
