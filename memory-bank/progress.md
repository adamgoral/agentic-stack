## Current Status

### System State
- **Backend**: Implemented and running
- **Frontend**: Fully implemented with CopilotKit integrated, accessible at http://localhost:3000
- **MCP Servers**: Implemented with mock data, running in containers
- **Agents**: Skeleton only, need implementation
- **Docker**: All services running healthy
- **CopilotKit**: Integrated and configured
- **Dependencies**: All fixed and validated
- **Integration**: Ready for testing
- **Infrastructure**: Fully operational

### Deployment Readiness
- **Local Development**: Ready with Docker
- **Production**: Requires additional security and monitoring

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
1. Mock web search needs real API integration
2. Python executor needs better sandboxing
3. No authentication mechanism yet
4. Missing comprehensive error handling

### Configuration Issues
- CORS configuration needs testing
- Redis connection pooling not optimized
- MCP server discovery is hardcoded
- API keys need to be added to .env file

### Resolved Issues
- ~~Docker dependency version mismatches~~ âœ…
- ~~Package name errors (mcp-server-fastmcp vs fastmcp)~~ âœ…
- ~~pydantic-ai version constraint (fixed to 0.4.11)~~ âœ…
- ~~Frontend build error (Tailwind CSS border-border class)~~ âœ…
- ~~Missing ag_ui_handler.py module~~ âœ…
- ~~Missing OpenTelemetry instrumentation packages~~ âœ…
- ~~All Docker containers failing to start~~ âœ…

## Evolution of Decisions

### Initial Approach
- Started with monolithic design
- Evolved to microservices for better separation

### Protocol Choices
1. **First**: Considered custom protocols
2. **Then**: Decided on PydanticAI standards
3. **Now**: Full commitment to A2A, AG-UI, MCP

### State Management
1. **Considered**: In-memory only
2. **Evaluated**: PostgreSQL
3. **Chosen**: Redis for simplicity and speed

### Frontend Framework
1. **Options**: Vanilla JS, React, Vue
2. **Selected**: Next.js for SSR and CopilotKit compatibility
3. **Implemented**: Full Next.js 14+ with App Router, TypeScript, TailwindCSS

### CopilotKit Integration
1. **Research**: Studied CopilotKit documentation via Context7
2. **Implementation**: Used AgnoAgent for AG-UI connection
3. **Architecture**: Separated client/server components properly
4. **Result**: Full integration with streaming support

### Dependency Management
1. **Initial**: Used estimated version numbers without verification
2. **Problem**: Docker builds failing due to non-existent package versions
3. **Solution**: Verified actual PyPI versions and corrected requirements
4. **Result**: All Docker services now build successfully

## Next Milestone

### MVP Completion (Target)
1. ~~Complete frontend with basic chat UI~~ âœ…
2. ~~Integrate CopilotKit with AG-UI~~ âœ…
3. ~~Fix Docker dependency issues~~ âœ…
4. ~~Start all Docker services successfully~~ âœ…
5. Test frontend and API connectivity
6. Implement and test research agent
7. Implement and test code agent
8. Successful end-to-end workflow demo
9. Basic error handling throughout

### Success Metrics
- User can submit complex query
- System decomposes into subtasks
- Agents complete work via tools
- Results stream to frontend
- Final answer aggregated correctly
