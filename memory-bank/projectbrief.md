# Project Brief

## Project Name
Agentic Stack - Production-Ready Multi-Agent System

## Purpose
Build an enterprise-grade multi-agent system that demonstrates Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design, and SOLID principles while showcasing PydanticAI's protocol ecosystem (A2A, AG-UI, MCP) in a production-ready implementation with modern Python tooling.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Implement an orchestrator agent that can decompose tasks and delegate to specialized agents
2. **Protocol Integration**: Fully utilize all three PydanticAI protocols:
   - A2A for agent-to-agent communication
   - AG-UI for frontend streaming interactions
   - MCP for external tool integration
3. **State Management**: Persistent state across agent interactions using Redis
4. **Real-time Updates**: Stream agent progress to frontend via Server-Sent Events
5. **Tool Access**: Connect to external tools (web search, Python execution) via MCP

### Technical Requirements
- Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and SOLID principles
- FastAPI backend with layered architecture (api/application/domain/infrastructure)
- Modern Python tooling: UV package management, Ruff linting, pyproject.toml
- Redis for context storage with repository pattern implementation
- Docker Compose orchestration of 9 production-ready services
- OpenTelemetry for enterprise observability
- Type-safe models with Pydantic throughout all layers
- Comprehensive test organization (unit/integration/e2e)
- Centralized documentation and simplified agent startup scripts

## Success Criteria
1. Enterprise architecture patterns (Clean Architecture, DDD, SOLID) fully implemented ✅
2. Modern Python tooling (UV, Ruff, pyproject.toml) configured for production ✅
3. All 9 Docker services operational with optimized builds ✅
4. Agents communicate and delegate tasks via A2A protocol ✅
5. Frontend receives real-time updates from agents via AG-UI ✅
6. Agents access external tools through MCP servers ✅
7. System handles complex multi-step workflows with proper error handling ✅
8. Comprehensive test organization with unit/integration/e2e structure ✅
9. Simplified agent startup scripts and centralized documentation ✅
10. Architecture is production-ready and deployment-capable ✅

## Constraints
- Implement enterprise-grade patterns while maintaining clarity
- Use only PydanticAI's official protocols (A2A, AG-UI, MCP)
- Ensure all components are containerized with Docker Compose
- Maintain clean separation of concerns with layered architecture
- Apply modern Python best practices throughout

## Target Users

- **AI/ML Engineers**: Professionals building scalable multi-agent systems
- **Software Architects**: Teams evaluating Clean Architecture with AI protocols
- **DevOps Engineers**: Teams implementing modern Python deployment patterns
- **Students/Researchers**: Learning enterprise software engineering with AI integration
