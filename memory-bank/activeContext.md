# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Core infrastructure (frontend, backend orchestrator, Redis, PostgreSQL) is running successfully. Frontend is accessible at http://localhost:3000/chat. Research and code agents have been implemented and should start successfully. Analytics agent still needs implementation, and MCP servers are failing on startup. Focus is now on implementing the analytics agent and debugging MCP server issues to enable full multi-agent functionality.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Fix Missing Components** (IN PROGRESS)
   - ✅ Implement research agent module at /backend/agents/research_agent.py
   - ✅ Implement code agent module at /backend/agents/code_agent.py
   - Implement analytics agent module at /backend/agents/analytics_agent.py
   - Fix MCP server implementations that are exiting
   - Test all agent containers after implementations

2. **Functionality Testing** (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)
   - ✅ Frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000/chat
   - ✅ CopilotKit UI is visible and functional
   - ✅ Backend orchestrator is running
   - ⚠️ Limited functionality without specialized agents

3. **Agent Implementation**
   - ✅ Created A2A-enabled research agent with PydanticAI
   - ✅ Created A2A-enabled code agent with PydanticAI
   - ✅ Implemented web search integration for research agent
   - ✅ Implemented code execution for code agent
   - Add analytics capabilities to analytics agent (pending)

4. **MCP Server Fixes**
   - Debug why MCP servers are exiting
   - Ensure proper FastMCP implementation
   - Verify stdio transport configuration

### Medium Priority
- Add authentication layer
- Implement real web search API
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Create unit tests

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Redis for State**: Chosen for simplicity and performance
- **FastAPI**: Selected for async support and automatic OpenAPI
- **Docker Compose**: Used for local development ease

### Protocol Implementation
- **AG-UI via SSE**: Using Server-Sent Events for simplicity
- **A2A with Context**: Maintaining conversation threads
- **MCP stdio**: Local servers use stdio transport

## Important Patterns

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation when tools unavailable
- Stream errors to frontend as events
- Maintain partial results on failure

### State Management
- StateDeps for AG-UI state synchronization
- Redis for persistent context
- In-memory caching for performance

## Learnings and Insights

### Protocol Integration
- A2A and AG-UI can share the same FastAPI app
- MCP servers are best isolated in containers
- Context IDs are crucial for conversation continuity

### Implementation Challenges
- Docker networking requires careful configuration
- SSE requires proper CORS handling
- Tool timeout management is critical
- Package version mismatches can break builds completely

### Best Practices Discovered
- Keep orchestrator agent lightweight
- Use dedicated agents for specific domains
- Stream early and often for better UX
- Maintain clear protocol boundaries
- Use specialized agents (react-frontend-developer) for complex setups
- Frontend structure should support both chat and monitoring views
- CopilotKit requires proper client/server component separation in Next.js 14+
- AgnoAgent from @ag-ui/agno package provides seamless AG-UI integration
- Environment variables crucial for backend URL configuration
- Always verify package names and versions on PyPI before using in requirements.txt
- pydantic-ai latest version is 0.4.11, not 0.12.0
- Use fastmcp instead of mcp-server-fastmcp for MCP server implementation
- Tailwind CSS classes must be defined in config or CSS layers
- Always create all imported modules before building Docker images
- Include all required OpenTelemetry instrumentation packages in requirements
- Agent implementation pattern: Use same structure across all agents for consistency
- Agent modules need __init__.py and __main__.py for proper Docker execution
- Use environment detection to handle Docker vs local networking differences

## Current Blockers
- ~~Docker dependency issues (fixed - pydantic-ai 0.4.11, fastmcp 2.11.1)~~ ✅
- ~~Docker build errors (fixed - Tailwind CSS, missing modules, OTel deps)~~ ✅
- ~~Docker services need to be started and tested~~ ✅ Core services running
- ~~**Missing agent implementations**: research_agent.py, code_agent.py~~ ✅ Implemented
- **Missing agent implementation**: analytics_agent.py still needed
- **MCP servers failing**: Both web search and Python executor exiting on startup
- API keys need to be added to .env file for full functionality

## Questions for Consideration
1. Should we add a message queue for better scalability?
2. How should we handle agent versioning?
3. What's the best approach for tool discovery?
