# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Agent delegation has been successfully tested and verified working! The orchestrator correctly analyzes incoming tasks and routes them to the appropriate specialized agents (research, code, analytics) via A2A protocol. All agents respond with 200 OK and receive tasks properly. Current focus is on implementing proper result aggregation - agents currently return placeholder results that need to be replaced with actual task execution and meaningful responses for the full MVP to be complete.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. ~~**Fix MCP Servers**~~ ✅ (COMPLETED)
   - Both servers now running successfully on ports 3001 and 3002
   - Converted from stdio to HTTP/SSE transport
   - Health checks verified working

2. ~~**Test Agent Delegation**~~ ✅ (COMPLETED)
   - All agents receive tasks correctly via A2A protocol
   - Orchestrator routing logic working as expected
   - 100% success rate on delegation tests

3. **Implement Result Aggregation** (HIGH PRIORITY - NEXT)
   - Replace placeholder results with actual task execution
   - Implement proper MCP tool calls in agents
   - Aggregate results from multiple agents in orchestrator
   - Stream real results back through AG-UI

4. **Integration Testing** (AFTER AGGREGATION)
   - Test end-to-end workflow with complex queries
   - Verify streaming updates to frontend
   - Check Redis context persistence across agents

4. **System Validation**
   - Run complete Docker stack with all agents
   - Test frontend to backend communication
   - Verify streaming updates via AG-UI
   - Monitor agent logs for errors
   - Performance testing with concurrent requests

### Medium Priority
- Add authentication layer
- Implement real web search API
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Create unit tests

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Redis for State**: Chosen for simplicity and performance
- **FastAPI**: Selected for async support and automatic OpenAPI
- **Docker Compose**: Used for local development ease

### Protocol Implementation
- **AG-UI via SSE**: Using Server-Sent Events for simplicity
- **A2A with Context**: Maintaining conversation threads
- **MCP stdio**: Local servers use stdio transport

## Important Patterns

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation when tools unavailable
- Stream errors to frontend as events
- Maintain partial results on failure

### State Management
- StateDeps for AG-UI state synchronization
- Redis for persistent context
- In-memory caching for performance

## Learnings and Insights

### Protocol Integration
- A2A and AG-UI can share the same FastAPI app
- MCP servers are best isolated in containers
- Context IDs are crucial for conversation continuity

### Implementation Challenges
- Docker networking requires careful configuration
- SSE requires proper CORS handling
- Tool timeout management is critical
- Package version mismatches can break builds completely

### Best Practices Discovered
- Keep orchestrator agent lightweight
- Use dedicated agents for specific domains
- Stream early and often for better UX
- Maintain clear protocol boundaries
- Use specialized agents (react-frontend-developer) for complex setups
- Frontend structure should support both chat and monitoring views
- CopilotKit requires proper client/server component separation in Next.js 14+
- AgnoAgent from @ag-ui/agno package provides seamless AG-UI integration
- Environment variables crucial for backend URL configuration
- Always verify package names and versions on PyPI before using in requirements.txt
- pydantic-ai latest version is 0.4.11, not 0.12.0
- Use fastmcp instead of mcp-server-fastmcp for MCP server implementation
- Tailwind CSS classes must be defined in config or CSS layers
- Always create all imported modules before building Docker images
- Include all required OpenTelemetry instrumentation packages in requirements
- Agent implementation pattern: Use same structure across all agents for consistency
- Agent modules need __init__.py and __main__.py for proper Docker execution
- Use environment detection to handle Docker vs local networking differences
- Analytics agent doesn't require MCP server - uses built-in Python capabilities
- All three specialized agents follow identical implementation patterns for consistency
- MCP servers must use HTTP/SSE transport when agents connect remotely (not stdio)
- FastAPI with SSE endpoints is the correct pattern for MCP server remote access
- Tool execution requires both SSE for discovery and HTTP endpoints for invocation

## Current Blockers
- ~~Docker dependency issues (fixed - pydantic-ai 0.4.11, fastmcp 2.11.1)~~ ✅
- ~~Docker build errors (fixed - Tailwind CSS, missing modules, OTel deps)~~ ✅
- ~~Docker services need to be started and tested~~ ✅ All services running
- ~~**Missing agent implementations**: research_agent.py, code_agent.py, analytics_agent.py~~ ✅ All implemented
- ~~**MCP servers failing**: Both web search and Python executor exiting on startup~~ ✅ Fixed
- ~~**Agent delegation not working**~~ ✅ Fixed and tested - 100% success rate
- **Result aggregation using placeholders** - Agents need to execute actual tasks
- **API keys need to be added to .env file for full functionality** (for real web search)

## Questions for Consideration
1. Should we add a message queue for better scalability?
2. How should we handle agent versioning?
3. What's the best approach for tool discovery?
