# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Initial MVP implementation of the Agentic Stack with full PydanticAI protocol integration.

## Recent Changes

### Completed
1. **Architecture Design** (MVP_DESIGN.md)
   - Comprehensive 8-section design document
   - Visual diagrams for system architecture
   - Protocol integration specifications

2. **Backend Implementation**
   - FastAPI server with AG-UI endpoints
   - Orchestrator agent with all three protocols
   - A2A manager for agent communication
   - Redis-based context storage
   - Monitoring setup with OpenTelemetry

3. **MCP Servers**
   - Python executor with sandboxed execution
   - Web search server with mock implementation
   - Dockerfiles for both servers

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Docker Compose configuration
   - Multi-service orchestration
   - Environment configuration template

5. **Memory Bank Initialization**
   - CLAUDE.md with Memory Bank structure
   - All core memory files created
   - Project documentation established

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Set up Next.js with CopilotKit
   - Implement AG-UI client
   - Create chat interface
   - Add state visualization

2. **Agent Implementation**
   - Create research agent with A2A
   - Create code generation agent
   - Test agent delegation flow

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test A2A communication
   - Verify AG-UI streaming
   - Validate MCP tool calls

### Medium Priority
- Add authentication layer
- Implement real web search API
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Create unit tests

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Redis for State**: Chosen for simplicity and performance
- **FastAPI**: Selected for async support and automatic OpenAPI
- **Docker Compose**: Used for local development ease

### Protocol Implementation
- **AG-UI via SSE**: Using Server-Sent Events for simplicity
- **A2A with Context**: Maintaining conversation threads
- **MCP stdio**: Local servers use stdio transport

## Important Patterns

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation when tools unavailable
- Stream errors to frontend as events
- Maintain partial results on failure

### State Management
- StateDeps for AG-UI state synchronization
- Redis for persistent context
- In-memory caching for performance

## Learnings and Insights

### Protocol Integration
- A2A and AG-UI can share the same FastAPI app
- MCP servers are best isolated in containers
- Context IDs are crucial for conversation continuity

### Implementation Challenges
- Docker networking requires careful configuration
- SSE requires proper CORS handling
- Tool timeout management is critical

### Best Practices Discovered
- Keep orchestrator agent lightweight
- Use dedicated agents for specific domains
- Stream early and often for better UX
- Maintain clear protocol boundaries

## Current Blockers
None at present - ready to proceed with frontend implementation and agent testing.

## Questions for Consideration
1. Should we add a message queue for better scalability?
2. How should we handle agent versioning?
3. What's the best approach for tool discovery?
