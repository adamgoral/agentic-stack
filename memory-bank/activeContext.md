# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Core infrastructure (frontend, backend orchestrator, Redis, PostgreSQL) is running successfully. Frontend is accessible at http://localhost:3000/chat. However, specialized agents (research, code, analytics) and MCP servers are failing due to missing implementations. Focus is now on implementing these missing components to enable full multi-agent functionality.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Fix Missing Components** (CRITICAL)
   - Implement research agent module at /backend/agents/research_agent.py
   - Implement code agent module at /backend/agents/code_agent.py
   - Implement analytics agent module at /backend/agents/analytics_agent.py
   - Fix MCP server implementations that are exiting

2. **Functionality Testing** (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)
   - ✅ Frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000/chat
   - ✅ CopilotKit UI is visible and functional
   - ✅ Backend orchestrator is running
   - ⚠️ Limited functionality without specialized agents

3. **Agent Implementation**
   - Create proper A2A-enabled agents with PydanticAI
   - Implement web search integration for research agent
   - Implement code execution for code agent
   - Add analytics capabilities to analytics agent

4. **MCP Server Fixes**
   - Debug why MCP servers are exiting
   - Ensure proper FastMCP implementation
   - Verify stdio transport configuration

### Medium Priority
- Add authentication layer
- Implement real web search API
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Create unit tests

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Redis for State**: Chosen for simplicity and performance
- **FastAPI**: Selected for async support and automatic OpenAPI
- **Docker Compose**: Used for local development ease

### Protocol Implementation
- **AG-UI via SSE**: Using Server-Sent Events for simplicity
- **A2A with Context**: Maintaining conversation threads
- **MCP stdio**: Local servers use stdio transport

## Important Patterns

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation when tools unavailable
- Stream errors to frontend as events
- Maintain partial results on failure

### State Management
- StateDeps for AG-UI state synchronization
- Redis for persistent context
- In-memory caching for performance

## Learnings and Insights

### Protocol Integration
- A2A and AG-UI can share the same FastAPI app
- MCP servers are best isolated in containers
- Context IDs are crucial for conversation continuity

### Implementation Challenges
- Docker networking requires careful configuration
- SSE requires proper CORS handling
- Tool timeout management is critical
- Package version mismatches can break builds completely

### Best Practices Discovered
- Keep orchestrator agent lightweight
- Use dedicated agents for specific domains
- Stream early and often for better UX
- Maintain clear protocol boundaries
- Use specialized agents (react-frontend-developer) for complex setups
- Frontend structure should support both chat and monitoring views
- CopilotKit requires proper client/server component separation in Next.js 14+
- AgnoAgent from @ag-ui/agno package provides seamless AG-UI integration
- Environment variables crucial for backend URL configuration
- Always verify package names and versions on PyPI before using in requirements.txt
- pydantic-ai latest version is 0.4.11, not 0.12.0
- Use fastmcp instead of mcp-server-fastmcp for MCP server implementation
- Tailwind CSS classes must be defined in config or CSS layers
- Always create all imported modules before building Docker images
- Include all required OpenTelemetry instrumentation packages in requirements

## Current Blockers
- ~~Docker dependency issues (fixed - pydantic-ai 0.4.11, fastmcp 2.11.1)~~ ✅
- ~~Docker build errors (fixed - Tailwind CSS, missing modules, OTel deps)~~ ✅
- ~~Docker services need to be started and tested~~ ✅ Core services running
- **Missing agent implementations**: research_agent.py, code_agent.py, analytics_agent.py not found
- **MCP servers failing**: Both web search and Python executor exiting on startup
- API keys need to be added to .env file for full functionality

## Questions for Consideration
1. Should we add a message queue for better scalability?
2. How should we handle agent versioning?
3. What's the best approach for tool discovery?
