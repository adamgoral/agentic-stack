   - Replaced mcp-server-fastmcp with correct fastmcp>=2.11.1 package
   - Updated all MCP server requirements files
   - All Docker services now build successfully
   - Memory bank documentation updated

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Docker Service Testing**
   - Start all Docker services with docker-compose up
   - Verify all containers build and start successfully
   - Test basic connectivity between services
   - Validate environment configuration

2. **Backend Testing**
   - Verify AG-UI endpoint is accessible at /ag-ui
   - Test CopilotKit connection to backend
   - Validate streaming responses
   - Check Redis connectivity

3. **Agent Implementation**
   - Create research agent with A2A
   - Create code generation agent
   - Test agent delegation flow

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Test A2A communication
   - Verify AG-UI streaming
   - Validate MCP tool calls

### Medium Priority
- Add authentication layer
- Implement real web search API
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Create unit tests

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Redis for State**: Chosen for simplicity and performance
- **FastAPI**: Selected for async support and automatic OpenAPI
- **Docker Compose**: Used for local development ease

### Protocol Implementation
- **AG-UI via SSE**: Using Server-Sent Events for simplicity
- **A2A with Context**: Maintaining conversation threads
- **MCP stdio**: Local servers use stdio transport

## Important Patterns

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation when tools unavailable
- Stream errors to frontend as events
- Maintain partial results on failure

### State Management
- StateDeps for AG-UI state synchronization
- Redis for persistent context
- In-memory caching for performance

## Learnings and Insights

### Protocol Integration
- A2A and AG-UI can share the same FastAPI app
- MCP servers are best isolated in containers
- Context IDs are crucial for conversation continuity

### Implementation Challenges
- Docker networking requires careful configuration
- SSE requires proper CORS handling
- Tool timeout management is critical
- Package version mismatches can break builds completely

### Best Practices Discovered
- Keep orchestrator agent lightweight
- Use dedicated agents for specific domains
- Stream early and often for better UX
- Maintain clear protocol boundaries
- Use specialized agents (react-frontend-developer) for complex setups
- Frontend structure should support both chat and monitoring views
- CopilotKit requires proper client/server component separation in Next.js 14+
- AgnoAgent from @ag-ui/agno package provides seamless AG-UI integration
- Environment variables crucial for backend URL configuration
- Always verify package names and versions on PyPI before using in requirements.txt
- pydantic-ai latest version is 0.4.11, not 0.12.0
- Use fastmcp instead of mcp-server-fastmcp for MCP server implementation

## Current Blockers
- ~~Docker dependency issues (fixed - pydantic-ai 0.4.11, fastmcp 2.11.1)~~ ✅
- API keys need to be added to .env file
- Docker services need to be started and tested
- Backend agents need implementation

## Questions for Consideration
1. Should we add a message queue for better scalability?
2. How should we handle agent versioning?
3. What's the best approach for tool discovery?
